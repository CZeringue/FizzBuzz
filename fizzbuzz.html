<!--Fiz Buzz Solution, by Caleb Zeringue-->

<!--Fizz Buzz counts from 1 to a given number, defined as x. 
If x is divisible by 3, the program will say "fizz" in lieu of the number. 
If X is divisible by 5, the program will instead, say "buzz." 
If x is divisible by both 3 AND 5, the program will print "FizzBuzz."
Else, the program will print the number.
